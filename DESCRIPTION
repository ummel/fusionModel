Description: fusionModel enables variables unique to a "donor" dataset to be statistically simulated for (i.e. fused to) a "recipient" dataset. The package provides a simple and efficient interface for general data fusion in R, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms from Microsoftâ€™s LightGBM framework. It also provides tools for analyzing synthetic/simulated data, calculating uncertainty, and validating fusion output.
